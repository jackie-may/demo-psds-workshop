# Pluralsight Design System Workshop

__Target audience:__ People who want to learn how to use the Design System, write JavaScript, understand React a bit.

__Format:__ Follow-along implementation of a visual design using the Design System.  You could also just watch, but that's less fun.  Open questions throughout.

__Desired outcome:__ Attendees feel more familiar with what's in the Design System, how to install it and apply it to a design in their project.

## Setup (do before coming)

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (any recent version should be fine)

```
git clone git@github.com:jaketrent/demo-psds-workshop.git
cd demo-psds-workshop
npm install
```

(Installation before the workshop will ensure you have the proper Design System code available to you in case Internet access at the conference is unreliable.)

## Topics

We will cover using many parts of the [Design System](https://design-system.pluralsight.com).  These parts include:

- 01 [Prism](https://bit.ly/prismnav)
- 02 [AsideLayout](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/layout/#aside-layout)
- 03 [Avatar](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/avatar/)
- 04 [Core spacing](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/core/spacing/)
- 05 [Text](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/text/)
- 06 [Core typography](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/core/typography/)
- 07 [Icon](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/icon/)
- 08 [Tag](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/tag/)
- 09 [PageHeadingLaying](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/layout/#page-heading-layout)

- 13 [Form.VerticalLayout](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/form/#form.verticallayout)
- 14 [TextInput](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/textinput/)
- 15 [Switch](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/switch/)
- 16 [Link](https://design-system.pluralsight.com/components/link/)

## Snippets

If you'd like to follow along but save your tired fingers a bunch of typing, you can use your copy-paste fingers to pull snippets out of the [snippets/](https://github.com/jaketrent/demo-psds-workshop/tree/master/snippets) directory.

Not every bit of code is recorded there, and day-of might turn out different (wing it!), but it could be helpful when you're trying to catch up or focus on a particular feature add.

## Goal

Learn to use the Design System by translating the mockup in [mockups/](https://github.com/jaketrent/demo-psds-workshop/tree/master/mockups) into a functional JavaScript UI using as much of the Design System as seems appropriate. 

## Start Editing

```
npm start
vim src/app.js
```
