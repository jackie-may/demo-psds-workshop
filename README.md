# Pluralsight Design System Workshop

__Target audience:__ People who want to learn how to use the Design System, write JavaScript, understand React a bit.

__Desired outcome:__ Attendees feel more familiar with what's in the Design System, how to install it and apply it to a design in their project.

## Setup (do before coming)

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (any recent version should be fine)

```
git clone git@github.com:jaketrent/demo-psds-workshop.git
cd demo-psds-workshop
npm install
```

(Installation before the workshop will ensure you have the proper Design System code available to you in case Internet access at the conference is unreliable.)
